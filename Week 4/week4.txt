Building Responsible AgentsBuilding Responsible
Agents & Robust Systems
◦ You've built impressive systems: from basic
LLM apps to workflows with Agentic RAGs.
◦ Now, we shift our focus to cultivating
responsible, reflective developers.
◦ Objective: Learn how to assess, debug,
and ethically design agentic AI systems.02
Why We EvaluateBeyond “It Works”
◦ Simply witnessing an agent complete a
task is often not enough. We need a
systematic approach to assess its
performance.
◦ Evaluation allows us to identify an agent's
true strengths, weaknesses, and potential
failure modes.
◦ It helps us understand if the agent is truly
fulfilling its objective, or just appears to be.Driving Improvement &
Building Trust
◦ Evaluation is crucial for debugging and
iteratively improving our agent designs. It's the
feedback loop that drives progress.
◦ Rigorously evaluated agents inspire
greater trust from users and stakeholders.
◦ Ensures agents are effective, reliable, and
safe when deployed in real-world scenarios.03
How Evaluation is
DoneCore Evaluation Metrics
for Agents
◦ Task Success Rate: Does the agent reliably
complete the task it was assigned?
◦ Efficiency: How much time and computational
resources does it consume?
◦ Accuracy & Hallucination Rate: Is the information
provided factual and free from fabricated content?
◦ User Experience Quality: Is the agent intuitive,
helpful, and pleasant to interact with?Deeper Dive: Context, Cost & Scalability
Optimization of CostScalability
▪ Assess resource consumption,
including API calls and
computational expenses.▪ How well does the system
perform under increased load,
more users, or more complex
tasks?
▪ Efficient context management
and tool selection (e.g., deciding
when to use a retrieval tool vs. a
calculator) directly impact cost
effectiveness.
▪ A well-designed agentic solution
must be scalable to be viable in
real-world applications.04
Risks of
Agentic AIThe Darker Side: Unintended
Consequences
◦ Over-autonomy & Unintended Actions: Agents,
especially in multi-agent systems, might take actions that
deviate from their intended purpose without sufficient
human oversight.
◦ Hallucinations Compounded in Loops: Small
inaccuracies or "hallucinations" can be amplified and
become critical errors when agents operate in iterative
decision-making loops.Societal & Ethical Challenges
◦ Privacy: Agents handling sensitive user data raise
concerns about data security and privacy.
◦ Bias & Discrimination: Agents can inadvertently
learn and perpetuate biases present in their training
data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
◦ Misalignment: Ensuring the agent's goals and
objectives truly align with human values and intentions.
◦ Legal & Societal Implications: Complex questions
arise regarding accountability and responsibility when an
autonomous agent makes a mistake or causes harm.05
Staying
Ahead in AIWhy Stay Ahead in AI?
AI is transforming every industry — staying ahead
means leading change, not following it.
It’s a powerful tool — boosts creativity, productivity, and
problem-solving.
Falling behind is costly — you risk being a passive
consumer instead of an empowered creator.How I Stay Ahead in AI
Learn Relentlessly — follow research, test new
frameworks, and study real-world use cases.
Build & Experiment — I create projects (bots, apps,
fine-tuned models) to apply knowledge hands-on.
Change that Youtube Feed!Conclusion
◦ Evaluation is non-negotiable for building robust, efficient, and
trustworthy agentic AI systems.
◦ Understanding the risks is the first step toward mitigating them
effectively.
◦ As developers, you have a crucial role in shaping the future of
responsible AI.Thanks!
